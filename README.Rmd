Tools for Handling Extraction of Features from Time series (theft)

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
comment = NA, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8, cache = FALSE)
```

## Installation

You can install the stable version of `theft` from CRAN:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("theft")
```

You can install the development version of `theft` from GitHub using the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/theft")
```

Please also check out our paper [Feature-Based Time-Series Analysis in R using the theft Package](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06146) which discusses the motivation and theoretical underpinnings of `theft` and walks through all of its functionality using the [Bonn EEG dataset](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11736210/) --- a well-studied neuroscience dataset.

## General purpose

`theft` is a software package for R that facilitates user-friendly access to a consistent interface for the extraction of time-series features. The package provides a single point of access to $>1100$ time-series features from a range of existing R and Python packages as well as enabling users to calculate their own features. The packages which `theft` 'steals' features from currently are:

* [catch22](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-019-00647-x) (R; [see `Rcatch22` for the native implementation on CRAN](https://github.com/hendersontrent/Rcatch22))
* [feasts](https://feasts.tidyverts.org) (R)
* [tsfeatures](https://github.com/robjhyndman/tsfeatures) (R)
* [Kats](https://facebookresearch.github.io/Kats/) (Python)
* [tsfresh](https://tsfresh.com) (Python)
* [TSFEL](https://tsfel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Python)

Users can also calculate their own individual features or sets of features too!

Note that `Kats`, `tsfresh` and `TSFEL` are Python packages. `theft` has built-in functionality for helping you install these libraries---all you need to do is install Python on your machine (preferably Python >=3.10). If you wish to access the Python feature sets, please run `?install_python_pkgs` in R after downloading `theft` or consult the vignette in the package for more information. For a comprehensive comparison of these six feature sets across a range of domains (including computation speed, within-set feature composition, and between-set feature correlations), please refer to the paper [An Empirical Evaluation of Time-Series Feature Sets](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9679937).

As of `v0.6.1`, users can also supply their own features to `theft` (see the vignette for more information)!

## Package extensibility

The companion package [`theftdlc`](https://github.com/hendersontrent/theftdlc) ('`theft` downloadable content'---just like you get [DLCs and expansions](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring/shadow-of-the-erdtree) for video games) contains an extensive suite of functions for analysing, interpreting, and visualising time-series features calculated from `theft`. Collectively, these packages are referred to as the '`theft` ecosystem'.

A high-level overview of how the `theft` ecosystem for R is typically accessed by users is shown below. Note that prior to `v0.6.1` of, many of the `theftdlc` functions were contained in `theft` but under other names. To ensure the `theft` ecosystem is as user-friendly as possible and can scale to meet future demands, `theft` has been refactored to just perform feature extraction, while `theftdlc` handles all the processing, analysis, and visualisation of the extracted features.

Many more functions and options for customisation are available within the packages and users are encouraged to explore the vignettes and helper files for more information.

## Quick tour

`theft` and `theftdlc` combine to create an intuitive and efficient workflow consistent with the broader [`tidyverts`](https://tidyverts.org) collection of packages for tidy time-series analysis. Here is a single code chunk that calculates features for a [`tsibble`](https://tsibble.tidyverts.org) (tidy temporal data frame) of some simulated time series processes, including Gaussian noise, AR(1), ARMA(1,1), MA(1), noisy sinusoid, and a random walk. `simData` comes with `theft`. We'll just use the [`catch22`](https://github.com/hendersontrent/Rcatch22) feature set and a custom set of mean and standard deviation for now. Using tidy principles and pipes, we can, in the same code chunk, feed the calculated features straight into `theftdlc`'s `project` function to project the 24-dimensional feature space into an interpretable two-dimensional space using principal components analysis:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
library(dplyr)
library(theft)
library(theftdlc)

calculate_features(data = theft::simData, 
                   feature_set = "catch22",
                   features = list("mean" = mean, "sd" = sd)) %>%
  project(norm_method = "RobustSigmoid",
          unit_int = TRUE,
          low_dim_method = "PCA") %>%
  plot()
```

In that example, `calculate_features` comes from `theft`, while `project` and the `plot` generic come from `theftdlc`.

Similarly, we can perform time-series classification using a similar workflow to compare the performance of `catch22` against our custom set of the first two moments of the distribution:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
calculate_features(data = theft::simData, 
                   feature_set = "catch22",
                   features = list("mean" = mean, "sd" = sd)) %>%
  classify(by_set = TRUE,
           n_resamples = 10,
           use_null = TRUE) %>%
  compare_features(by_set = TRUE,
                   hypothesis = "pairwise") %>%
  head()
```

In this example, `classify` and `compare_features` come from `theftdlc`.

We can also easily see how each set performs relative to an empirical null distribution (i.e., how much better does each set do than we would expect due to chance?):

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
calculate_features(data = theft::simData, 
                   feature_set = "catch22",
                   features = list("mean" = mean, "sd" = sd)) %>%
  classify(by_set = TRUE,
           n_resamples = 10,
           use_null = TRUE) %>%
  compare_features(by_set = TRUE,
                   hypothesis = "null") %>%
  head()
```

Please see the vignette for more information and the full functionality of both packages.
