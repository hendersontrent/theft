Tools for Handling Extraction of Features from Time series (theft)

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
comment = NA, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8, cache = FALSE)
```

## Installation

You can install the stable version of `theft` from CRAN:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("theft")
```

You can install the development version of `theft` from GitHub using the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/theft")
```

Please also check out our paper [Feature-Based Time-Series Analysis in R using the theft Package](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06146) which discusses the motivation and theoretical underpinnings of `theft` and walks through all of its functionality using the [Bonn EEG dataset](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.64.061907) --- a well-studied neuroscience dataset.

## General purpose

`theft` is a software package for R that facilitates user-friendly access to a structured analytical workflow for the extraction, analysis, and visualisation of time-series features. The package provides a single point of access to $>1200$ time-series features from a range of existing R and Python packages. The packages which `theft` 'steals' features from currently are:

* [catch22](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-019-00647-x) (R; [see `Rcatch22` for the native implementation on CRAN](https://github.com/hendersontrent/Rcatch22))
* [feasts](https://feasts.tidyverts.org) (R)
* [tsfeatures](https://github.com/robjhyndman/tsfeatures) (R)
* [Kats](https://facebookresearch.github.io/Kats/) (Python)
* [tsfresh](https://tsfresh.com) (Python)
* [TSFEL](https://tsfel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Python)

Note that `Kats`, `tsfresh` and `TSFEL` are Python packages. `theft` has built-in functionality for helping you install these libraries---all you need to do is install Python 3.9 on your machine. If you wish to access the Python feature sets, please run `?install_python_pkgs` in R after downloading `theft` or consult the vignette in the package for more information. For a comprehensive comparison of these six feature sets across a range of domains (including computation speed, within-set feature composition, and between-set feature correlations), please refer to the paper [An Empirical Evaluation of Time-Series Feature Sets](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9679937).

The core workflow for feature-based time-series analysis (and corresponding functions) in `theft` is presented below:

As you can see from the graphic above, `theft` contains a convenient and extensive suite of tools for semi-automated processing of extracted features (including data quality assessments and normalisation methods), low dimensional projections (linear and nonlinear), data matrix and feature distribution visualisations, time-series classification procedures, statistical hypothesis testing, and various other statistical and graphical tools.
